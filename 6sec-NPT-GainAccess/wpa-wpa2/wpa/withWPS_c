1. Trying by WPS.
Looking for networks with enabled WPS feature:
> wash -i wlan0mon

So we can brute force to find the 8 digit long pin that WPS
uses to auth (Average 10 hours). 
Then you can try bruteforce to find the PIN with reaver, and
find the PSK:
> reaver -b [targ MAC] -c 11 -i wlan0mon

You will have to use options to try to connect, because some 
routers will block you, after some attempts. (--help)
