We can inject packets into the trafic. But we have to authenticate our wifi
card with the AP, because AP's ignore any requests that come from devices 
that are not associated with the AP. This can be done easily using airmon-ng

1. Fake authentication
> aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a [target MAC] -h [My MAC] [interface]

if this fake authentication was successful the value under the "AUTH" 
column in airodump-ng will change to "OPN"

2. Now we have to wait for an ARP packet, and capture it and inject
it into the traffic. This will force the AP to generate a new ARP packet with a new IV, we capture this new packet and inject into the traffic again, this process is repeated until the number of IV's
captured is sufficient enough to crack the key
> aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b [targ MAC] -h [my MAC] [interface]
