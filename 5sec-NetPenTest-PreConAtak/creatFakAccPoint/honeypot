Set up:

1. One card connected to the internet
2. Wifi card to broadcast as an access point

We'll use Mana-toolkit that automatically creates a new APand 
starts sslstrip/firelamp and even attemps to bypass HSTS with is
used by Gmail and Facebook.
Mana has 3 main start scripts:

1. start-noupstream: starts AP with no internet connection
2. start-nat-simple: this starts a regular AP connection in 
   the upstream interface.
3. start-nat-full: starts AP with internet connection, it also
   starts sslstrip, sslsplit, firelamp and attempts to 
   bypass HSTS.

ps.: Installing mana-toolkit:
> apt-get install mana-toolkit 

> gedit /etc/mana-toolkit/hostapd-mana.conf
# modify the settings of the AP. The most important
# is the interface that we'll use to broadcast the signal.

> gedit /usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh
# Verify "again" the options (interface and etc).
# Most important, you need to specify the card that
# has internet connection.

> bash /usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh
